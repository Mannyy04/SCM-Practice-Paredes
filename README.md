# Software Configuration Management (SCM) and GitHub

## What is SCM?
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the practice of systematically managing changes to software to maintain its integrity and traceability throughout the development lifecycle. SCM helps teams organize code, track changes, and collaborate efficiently.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that uses Git, a distributed version control system. It simplifies SCM by allowing teams to:
- Track and revert changes
- Collaborate asynchronously
- Manage multiple branches and merge code safely
- Review and approve updates through pull requests
- Maintain a detailed history of changes for accountability and learning
